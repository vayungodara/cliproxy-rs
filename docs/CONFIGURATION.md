# Configuration

cliproxy-rs reads one YAML file, `config.yaml`. Pass its path with `--config`; without it, the server reads `config.yaml` in the current directory. It accepts CLIProxyAPI's v8 layout (shown here) and the older flat layout, and every setting in CLIProxyAPI's [`config.example.yaml`](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/blob/6fecc6e5567912661654a4eaf9b8f5436facd1c2/config.example.yaml) is accepted. Settings for features that are not ported yet are kept in the file but have no effect.

The server watches the file and applies most changes within a second, without a restart. `server.host`, `server.port`, `server.tls` and `server.trusted-proxies` are read at start, so restart after changing them. When the dashboard or the Management API changes a setting, only that key is rewritten; the rest of the file, comments included, stays as it was.

## A complete small example

```yaml
config-version: 8
server:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8317
access:
  api-keys:
    - "your-client-key"
management:
  secret-key: "your-management-key"
oauth:
  auth-dir: "~/.cliproxy-rs/auth"
routing:
  strategy: round-robin
  session-affinity: true
  retry:
    request-retry: 2
observability:
  logs:
    logging-to-file: true
```

## server

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `host` | The address to listen on. `"127.0.0.1"` accepts only this computer; `""` listens on every interface. |
| `port` | The port, `8317` by default. |
| `tls.enable`, `tls.cert`, `tls.key` | Serve HTTPS on the same port with this certificate and key file. |
| `trusted-proxies` | Addresses of reverse proxies or tunnels whose `X-Forwarded-For` header is trusted. Set it when a tunnel on the same machine forwards requests, for example `[127.0.0.1, "::1"]`. See [running it safely](GETTING-STARTED.md#running-it-safely). |

## access

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `api-keys` | The client keys your tools send, as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key` or `?key=`. Keep at least one; with an empty list anyone who can reach the server can use it. |

## management

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `secret-key` | The dashboard and Management API password. A plaintext value is replaced by its bcrypt hash on first start. The `MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD` environment variable works too. When neither is set, the management API is off. |
| `allow-remote` | `false` (the default) accepts management requests from this computer only. |
| `disable-control-panel` | `true` stops serving the dashboard at `/management.html`; the Management API keeps working. |

## oauth

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `auth-dir` | The folder for account sign-in files, `~/.cli-proxy-api` by default. `~` is expanded. The server watches it, so a file added, edited or removed there takes effect without a restart. |
| `providers.codex.chatgpt-keep-alive` | A cliproxy-rs addition, `false` by default. `true` keeps up to 2 idle connections to `chatgpt.com` per proxy for 90 seconds, so Codex HTTP requests skip the TCP and TLS handshake. Off, every Codex request opens its own connection, as CLIProxyAPI does. A change applies from the next request, without a restart. Go starts with the key in the file and ignores it. A config edit through Go's v8 Management API moves the key into a comment, so the setting is off again when you return to cliproxy-rs; edits through Go's v0 endpoints keep it. Setting the key through Go's v8 API is refused, as for any key Go does not know. |

## api-keys

Provider API keys, as opposed to account sign-ins, go here, grouped by provider: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `vertex`, `xai` and `openai-compatibility` for any service that speaks the OpenAI API. The dashboard's Provider keys page edits them. An OpenAI-compatible service, for example:

```yaml
api-keys:
  openai-compatibility:
    - name: openrouter
      base-url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
      keys:
        - api-key: "sk-or-..."
      models:
        - name: "moonshotai/kimi-k2"
          alias: "kimi-k2"
```

## routing

How the server picks an account for each request. [MULTI-ACCOUNT.md](MULTI-ACCOUNT.md) explains these in detail.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `strategy` | `round-robin` (the default), `fill-first`, `weighted-round-robin`, or `soonest-reset` (experimental and opt-in: select the account whose weekly window resets soonest). |
| `session-affinity` | `true` keeps a conversation on the account that served its first request. The installer writes `true` for new configs. If omitted, the server default is `false`, as in Go. |
| `session-affinity-ttl` | How long a conversation stays bound to its account, `"1h"` by default. |
| `retry.request-retry` | Extra rounds over the accounts after a failed attempt, `0` by default. |
| `retry.max-retry-credentials` | At most this many accounts tried per round; `0` means all of them. |
| `retry.max-retry-interval` | The longest wait, in seconds, for an account to come out of cooldown before retrying; `0` means do not wait. |
| `cooldown.disable-cooling` | `true` keeps failing accounts in rotation instead of resting them. |
| `cooldown.transient-error-cooldown-seconds` | How long to rest an account after a temporary upstream error; `0` means 60 seconds, a negative value turns it off. |
| `cooldown.save-cooldown-status` | `true` keeps cooldowns in `.cds` files in `auth-dir`, so a restart does not forget them. |
| `cooldown.max-trusted-cooldown` | A cliproxy-rs addition. When an account hits its usage limit, the provider says when it resets, sometimes days ahead, and the account rests until then. Providers often reset early, so cliproxy-rs trusts the stated time for at most this long (`"1h"` by default; a Go duration such as `"90m"`, or a bare number meaning seconds; at least 10 seconds), then lets the next request through to check. If the account is still limited, the next rest is twice as long, and never longer than the stated reset. `0` trusts the stated reset, as CLIProxyAPI does. An unreadable value is logged and the default is used. See [differences from Go](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md#deliberate-differences). |

### Optional preset: fail over only on 429

This commented preset keeps 429 cooldown and failover for Claude and Codex OAuth accounts. It stops ordinary failover after a failed attempt for the listed non-429 statuses, without adding a cooldown. Credential-preparation failures and an enabled `requests.streaming.bootstrap-retries` can still cause another attempt. Unlisted statuses keep normal handling. The preset applies only to OAuth accounts and leaves plan limits and provider checks unchanged. A credential's own `request_scoped_errors` rules take precedence.

Uncomment the block to use it. `oauth-request-scoped-errors` is the legacy spelling of `oauth.request-scoped-errors`; use only one. `(?s).*` matches any body, including an empty one. Rules need a body matcher; status alone does not match.

```yaml
# oauth-request-scoped-errors:
#   claude: &plan-limits-only
#     - {status: 429, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: continue-and-cooldown}
#     - {status: 400, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 401, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 402, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 403, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 404, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 408, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 500, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 502, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 503, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#     - {status: 504, match-regexr: ["(?s).*"], action: stop}
#   codex: *plan-limits-only
```

## requests

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `proxy-url` | An outbound proxy for every upstream request, such as `socks5://127.0.0.1:1080` or `http://proxy:3128`. A single account can use its own proxy instead; see [per-account proxies](MULTI-ACCOUNT.md#per-account-proxies-and-request-shaping). |

Claude accounts ignore `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`. Without an explicit proxy, they connect directly. Set `requests.proxy-url` or the account's `proxy_url` when you need one. Claude API keys pointed at a custom, non-Anthropic base URL use the standard transport, which can inherit environment proxies.

## observability

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `logs.logging-to-file` | `true` writes the log to `main.log` in a `logs` folder, rotated, instead of standard output. |
| `logs.logs-max-total-size-mb` | The most disk space the log files may use. |
| `logs.request-log` | `true` writes one file per request with client and upstream request/response sections. Recognised sensitive headers and URL fields are masked, but bodies can contain credentials, including Realtime client secrets, as well as private prompts and output. Keep the logs private. |

## worker-threads

`worker-threads: 4` at the top level sets how many threads serve requests. Without it, cliproxy-rs uses the smaller of the CPU count and two, which is plenty for one person: a coding-agent request with a 300 KB prompt costs about 20 to 30 ms of CPU (a small chat request about 1 ms), and most of a request's time is spent waiting on the provider. Each extra thread can keep its own pool of freed memory, so more threads mean a larger resident size. The `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS` environment variable overrides it.

The key is read once at start from the `-config` file (`./config.yaml` by default), before a remote store (`PGSTORE_*`, `OBJECTSTORE_*`, `GITSTORE_*`) or Home supplies a config. It has no effect in a store's `config.yaml` or in the config Home supplies (the local `-config` file still applies); set `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS` there. A value there that differs from the running thread count logs a warning.

This setting exists only in cliproxy-rs. CLIProxyAPI starts with it in the file and keeps it through v0 Management API saves, but any v8 configuration write comments it out, and uploading a whole `config.yaml` that contains it is refused. With a config shared between the two servers, use `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS`. See [DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md).

## Environment

- `MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD`: the management key, instead of `management.secret-key`.
- `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS`: the number of request threads, instead of `worker-threads`.
- `RUST_LOG`: overrides the log level, for example `RUST_LOG=debug`.
- A `.env` file in the working directory is loaded at start, as in CLIProxyAPI.
- `PGSTORE_*`, `OBJECTSTORE_*` and `GITSTORE_*` keep the config and the account files in PostgreSQL, an S3-compatible bucket or a git repository, as in CLIProxyAPI.
